I am a final year Ph.D. student at , [IIIT-Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in). I work in the domain of *Computer Vision and Deep Learning*. I am advised by [Dr. Saket Anand](https://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~anands/). My Ph.D. is supported by [Visvesvarya Ph.D. Fellowship](https://phd.medialabasia.in/). During summer 2019, I was Ph.D. Research Intern at Media Analytics Department of [NEC Laboratories America](http://www.nec-labs.com/research-departments/media-analytics/media-analytics-home). I was working with [Prof. Manmohan Chandraker](http://www.nec-labs.com/~manu/), [Dr. Quoc-Huy Tran](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~huy/home.php), and [Dr. Pan Ji](https://sites.google.com/site/peterji1990).

**Research Interests:** <br>
I am interested in developing robust methods for *low-level geometric scene understanding* (e.g SfM/SLAM, multiple-geometric model fitting, image-based 3D modeling) and *high-level semantic understanding* (e.g image classification, object detection, segmentation). In general, for robust scene understanding, I am interested in developing methods that can handle *noise*, *outliers*, and *adversarial perturbations*.
